            <h1>YouTube MP3</h1>
            <p>YouTube.com is the largest video sharing platform on the Internet. Every day millions of new videos are
                added.
                You can
                find all kinds of videos but YouTube does not offer a FREE downloading service for these videos.

            YTMP3 allows you to download your favorite YouTube videos as MP3 (audio) or MP4 (video) files in the most
            efficient
            way.
            You are able to use YTMP3 on any device – it is optimized to work on desktop, tablet and mobile devices.
            There is
            also

            <h1>How to download YouTube videos?</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>Open YouTube.com and search for the video you would like to download.

                <li>When you find the video, click on it and wait until it starts playing. Then, just copy the video URL
                    from
                    your
                    browser address bar.</li>

                <li>Open YTMP3 and paste the video URL in our converter. After that you will be able to choose the
                    download
                    format. You
                    can choose between MP3 or MP4. If you do not choose any format the video will be converted by
                    default into a
                    MP3 file.</li>

                <li>Then, simply click on the „Convert” button. The conversion will be initiated, and may take a few
                    minutes. We
                    will try
                    to convert the video in the best available quality. But be aware that it is only possible to
                    download videos
                    that are up
                    to 90 minutes long, to guarantee that the conversion will be done within a few minutes.</li>

                <li>As soon as the conversion of the video is completed you will see a „Download” button. Just click on
                    it, and
                    the
                    download shall start.</li>
